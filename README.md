# PushyFinder for FINAL FANTASY XIV
A Dalamud plugin to ping your phone via [Pushover](https://pushover.net) whenever a Party Finder event or duty pop happens with an AFK client.

## Usage
Install the plugin, configure it using `/pf`, go AFK (look for the red icon) and enjoy.

You will need a valid [Pushover](https://pushover.net) license, application key and user key to use this.
Support for other push notification services is coming soon, but for now, evaluate for yourself whether a one-time $5 purchase is worth it. We think it is.

Or if you want to use Discord, you can use the Discord Webhook feature for free and also let people on your discord server know (if you want) how your PF Status is.

### Discord Setup
1. Go to your Text Channel where you want to receive notifications.
2. Go to settings and click on `Integrations`.
3. Click on `Create Webhook`.
4. Copy the `Webhook URL`.

### In Game
Configure the plugin in game using `/pf` command.
- Enter the ***Webhook Url*** you copied before.
- Can toggle the following options.
    - Send messages for duty pop
    - Ignore AFK status and always notify

***Don't forget to click on save and close after you are done.***
